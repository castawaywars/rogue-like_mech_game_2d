	<h1>Index</h1>

	<p>You can control the mechs with wasd, q for shooting, e for reloading for player 1 and ijkl, - for
		shooting, . for reloading for player two, or use the clickable tiles above and below the map, especially
		helpful on touch screens. Flamethrower player 1 is r, flamethrower player 2 is , . The flamethrower destroys
		enemies and spawners in a sort of cone-shape in front of the mech, and the flamethrower is the only way to
		get rid of spawners.<br>
		The walkable places are green, the mechs are <span class="player1 dark_mode">blue (player 1)</span> and
		<span class="player2">yellow (player 2)</span>, <span class="enemy">enemies are red</span>, <span
			class="spawner dark_mode">enemy spawners are black</span>, <span class="wall dark_mode">simple obstacles
			are grey</span>, health packs are white, and <span class="flamethrower_ammo">flamethrower ammo is
			orange.</span><br>
		You can see what direction the mech is facing by the black bar. Shooting shoots forward in whatever
		direction you are currently facing. Enemies die in one shot. If an enemy walks into you, he will damage you.
		If your health drops to 0, you die and the enemy that killed you is promoted into a new spawner on the spot
		you died on.<br>
		If your gun is out of ammo, you can't shoot, you will have to reload. Don't spam the reload button though,
		as reloading takes a second, and you can't shoot during the reloading.
