	<h1>Index</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the rogue-like mech game!<br>
		Feature cuts have resulted in the rogue-like elements getting removed (for now), but other than that, it's still
		a mech game. <br>
		You can control the mechs with wasd, q for shooting, e for reloading for player 1 and the arrow keys, - for
		shooting, . for reloading for player two, or use the clickable tiles above and below the map, especially helpful
		on touch screens.<br>
		The walkable places are green, the mechs are <span class="m">blue (player 1)</span> and <span class="n">yellow
			(player 2)</span>, <span class="e">enemies are red</span>, enemy spawners are black, <span class="w">simple
			obstacles are grey</span>, health packs are white, and <span class="f">flamethrower ammo (not functional
			yet) is orange.</span><br>
		You can see what direction the mech is facing by the black bar. Shooting shoots forward in whatever direction
		you are currently facing. Enemies die in one shot. If an enemy walks into you, he will damage you. If your
		health drops to 0, you die and the enemy that killed you is promoted into a new spawner on the spot you died
		on.<br>
		If your gun is out of ammo, you can't shoot, you will have to reload. Don't spam the reload button though, as
		reloading takes a second, and you can't shoot during the reloading.
